	<h1>Matt's Pringle Predicament</h1>
	<h2>Why on God's green earth are Pringles SO addicting?</h2>
	<img src="Photos/Matt.png" alt="pringles" width=300px class="center">
	<p>This is Matt. He has a problem. Every time his lovely wife comes home with a Pringle love note, he scarfs them down like there's no tomorrow. Why is this?</p>
	<p>Here might be a few reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pringles are bad for you. Things that are bad for you taste delicious. Thus, Pringles are delicious.</li>
		<li>Once you POP, the fun don't STOP? More like once you STACK, you're hooked like CRACK.</li>
		<li>Based on a scientifically-backed research study conducted by Amanda, Pringles, are indeed, CRACK.</li>
